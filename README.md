# Desktop Video Catalog
Video catalog project using JavaFX 8.

Application gives you ability to browse catalog of movies, series, cartoons from variety of websites. Its worked as standalone desktop application and requires Java 8 installed.

Application is currently in development on early stage with basic functionality implemented. It gives you access to three different websites archive and ability to watch videos via internal media player(developed with `MediaPlayer` class from JavaFX), webplayer(developed with video.js library) and user-defined player. Due to variety constraints from presented websites like unusual video encoding, requirement for additional http headers to playback video, some of the videofiles cannot be played in some of players.

Webplayer most likely will be deprecated in future release  because of low functionality presented in current JavaFX browser's classes.
